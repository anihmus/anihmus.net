    <h1 style="color:chartreuse">About Me</h1>
<center><img src="images/anihmus.jpg"></center>
<center><p style="color:chartreuse">When I was a kid, we had a pimped out Gateway (Mom splurged for the extra RAM) running MS-DOS and Windows 3.1. My Mom self taught her self everything about it and eventually got me some computer games. Kids, having very short attention spans even for the 90's meant that I would pester her to switch games from one to the next constantly. Annoyed with having to come up and down the basement stairs so many times, she opted instead to make me some DOS flash cards on how to change games my self. This very act would start my endless love for all things computer. It wasn't long after that I found myself online with AOL and marveling at the idea of an interconnected global community right at my fingertips. As I got older, I took as many computer classes as my Mom could find. In middle school I began my coding journey, first by learning Basic, then HTML. In high school I was enrolled in the Computer Magnet program where I learned more advanced programming in the form of Visual Basic (which killed my love of coding until 2024) as well as graphic design, and hardware maintenence. When I finally went to college for IT, it was my love of home networking that I persued in the form of a degree in Computer Network Technology. I quickly got my CompTIA A+ certification after and began building my own PC's and dual booting Linux with them. Linux has become my primary passion and this website is an exercise in utilizing all of these various skill sets at once.</p></center>

<center><p style="color:chartreuse">These days I find my self working mostly on this home lab for several reasons. The first is to aquire hands on experience with products I might encounter in an enterprise environment. I am much more of a hands on learner and the act of doing rather than reading or listening has always proven to be a more effective teacher. Secondly, I just love tech and playing around with tech and seeing what all it can do for me. There's so many projects and such out there that mastering it all would take multiple life times, but I like constantly keeping my finger on the pulse of creativity and innovation that the open source world of software has to offer.</p></center>
